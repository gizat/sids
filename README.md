# Siamese Neural Networks to Detect Infant Respiratory Movements in Video Sequences

Globally, 19,200 children less than one year of age became victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although the exact cause of SIDS is unknown, a number of preventive measures exist. One such measure is to detect infant respiratory movements in video sequences. However, detecting changes in night-vision video sequences using standard pixel-comparison methods is a challenging problem, because infrared lights and dark surroundings create noise that are entangled with the semantic changes. I propose an approach to compare similar- ity metrics between a pair of features generated from the convolutional layers of a siamese neural network. I demonstrate that the accuracy of the network depends on the choice of convolutional neural network model, image size, frame frequency and other factors.
